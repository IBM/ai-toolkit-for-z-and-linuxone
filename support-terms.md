# What to Expect From Support

IBM Elite Support for AI Toolkit for IBM® Z® and IBM® LinuxONE

## Scope of Service

IBM Elite Support for AI Toolkit for IBM Z and IBM® LinuxONE (the Service) is
remote assistance with the operation of supported Non-warranted and Open Source
Frameworks (ILAN or supplier-licensed, including fixes, licensed to users by the
Open Source supplier or support partner, under the Open Source supplier's or
support partner’s end user terms).

IBM provides support for eligible community supported Open Source Frameworks and
Non-warranted IBM code as entitled under the terms of the respective package
license. Open Source Communities are non-IBM entities or groups that create,
develop, edit, maintain, and share their packages and/or projects.

Frameworks
eligible for the Service are listed at
<https://www.ibm.com/products/ai-toolkit-for-z-and-linuxone> or as otherwise
provided by IBM. Frameworks eligible for the Service will follow the version
policy listed at
<https://github.com/IBM/ai-toolkit-for-z-and-linuxone#versioning>

IBM will:

- a. provide remote assistance to Client for all Covered Products (via telephone
  from IBM’s support center, or electronically) in response to requests
  pertaining to the following:

  1. basic, short duration installation, usage, and configuration questions;
  2. code-related problem questions;
  3. diagnostic information review to assist in isolation of a problem cause
    (for example, assistance interpreting traces and dumps for installation and
    code-related problems); and
  4. for certain known defects, IBM may provide available corrective service
    information and information about a method to obtain available program
    patches.

- b. assist Client in determining the cause of the problem and provide
  corrective information if it is available from IBM or the Open Source
  Community.
- c. report the defect to the respective Open Source Community or IBM team for
  IBM developed code, and inform Client of known actions taken and the
  availability of corrective information if a new defect (referenced or without
  known correction) is identified; and
- d. provide Client with guidance on how to obtain patches, maintenance updates
  or refreshes (collectively Fixes). IBM may provide workarounds as temporary
  solutions to Client or to the Open Source Community, so the Open Source
  Community can create permanent patches. There is no guarantee that the
  workarounds will be accepted by the Open Source Community as part of the main
  code branch.

licensed Framework code, nor does IBM guarantee patches or fixes will be
